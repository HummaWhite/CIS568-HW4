### Win/Loss Condition:
- The win/loss condition of the game is based on the player's life points. When a player's life points reach 0, the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins.

- **Snowball:** Randomly generated on the ground and can be used by players to attack. Players also receive one snowball per second.
- **Shield:** Randomly falls from the sky and can be used to block incoming snowball attacks from opponents.

### Two Goals:
1. **Defeat Opponents:** Players can earn points by hitting opponents with snowballs.
2. **Collect Snowflakes:** Players can earn points by collecting snowflakes.

- Players receive one snowball per second.
- Hitting a snowflake with a snowball earns the player points.
